Author's note -- I've mentioned it before, but I'll quickly mention it again. This reference list is appallingly incomplete. Please don't assume that these are the only sources I've relied upon. The final version of this book will have a {\it lot} more references. And if you see anything clever sounding in this book that doesn't seem to have a reference, I can absolutely promise you that the idea was someone else's. This is an introductory textbook: \underline{none} of the ideas are original. I'll take responsibility for all the errors, but I can't take credit for any of the good stuff. Everything smart in this book came from someone else, and they all deserve proper attribution for their excellent work. I just haven't had the chance to give it to them yet.
